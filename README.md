# Vendor Performance Analysis
### Techstack Used: Python(Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,SQLite libraries), SQL, PowerBI

Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing profitability in
the retail and wholesale industry. Companies need to ensure that they are not
incurring losses due to inefficient pricing, poor inventory turnover, or vendor
dependency. The goal of this analysis is to:
* Identify underperforming brands that require promotional or pricing
adjustments.
* Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit.
* Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs.
* Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs and improve efficiency.
* Investigate the profitability variance between high-performing and
low-performing vendors.

Data Cleansing using SQL queries gave a clean data consisting of 8564 useful records fetched from a very large dataset consisting of millions of records across multiple tables. After conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to uncover various trends and address certain key business issues, I prepared a PowerBI dashboard to effectively visualize key APIs and gain some valuable business insights. At the end, I prepared a report containing some insights and recommendations to the client based on the analysis performed.

A snapshot of the PowerBI dashboard is given below:
